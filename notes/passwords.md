# 1Password Setup

## Install

Download from [1password.com](https://1password.com/downloads/mac/) or via Homebrew:

```bash
brew install --cask 1password
```

## Notes

- Previously used 1Password's browser auto-fill extensions, but skipping them this time around.
- Will rely on the macOS desktop app and system-level autofill instead.
